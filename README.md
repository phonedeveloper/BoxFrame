# BoxFrame
An OpenSCAD file for 3D printing the frame of a box into which side panels are inserted.

Saves time over printing an entire box, while making changes easy and limiting changes to the panels that need them. Provides a solid frame for panel material including pressboard, acrylic, metal, or a 3D printed panel.

## Use

Open the file in OpenSCAD and answer the questions. More information is contained in the comments in the OpenSCAD file.

Box front or back. Unless you want it open, custom code is needed to provide a panel. For example, if this panel holds a fan, you could include standoffs to screw the fan into and holes for air flow.

Box top or bottom. Again, custom code is needed to provide a panel. For example, you could make cross-braces that hold standoffs into which an Arduino is screwed, while leaving most of the bottom open and grooves offset toward the outside of the box so that a metal or acrylic panel could be slid into place.
